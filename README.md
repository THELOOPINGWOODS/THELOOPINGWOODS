there's so many people i want to be friends with on this game but um..the issue is they r all at docks..andddi dont go to docks anymore..almost everyone at docks r weird as hell and seeing people sitting at the protree (ive blocked so many of u WHY DO U GUYS KEEP SPAWNING) near docks makes me uncomfortabl... im usually at bakery or the de area...i m too scared to approach people Brah Sorry :/
